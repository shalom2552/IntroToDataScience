## Question 1
	In this question we will be interested in the group of districts D. <br>
	These are the districts whose name begins with S or L. <br>
	In this question we calculates the mean and median for those districts with the given features below. <br>

## Question 2
	In this question we will help the Italian Corona Cabinet decide whether to impose a curfew on Italian
    closure policy. We will define a good day for the district if the number of recoverers in it was higher than the
    number of newly diagnosed, otherwise it will be considered a bad day. We will define a district as a green district
    if the number of good days recorded in the data is greater than 340. It was decided that if the number of non-green
    districts documented in the data is greater than 10 a closure will be imposed on the whole state otherwise a closure
    will be imposed only on the non-green districts.
